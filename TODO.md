## Technical Challenges and Blockers

1. Runtime Compatibility
   - Challenge: Maintaining dual runtime support while keeping CLI functionality
   - Impact: Critical for browser/edge deployment
   - Solution: Strict separation of fs/promises code, runtime-specific entry points

2. Component Discovery
   - Challenge: Automatic JSX/React component inference
   - Impact: Key feature for zero-config operation
   - Solution: Implement heuristic-based detection system

3. Performance Optimization
   - Challenge: Efficient concurrent processing
   - Impact: Affects large-scale MDX generation
   - Solution: Implement chunked processing with proper backpressure

4. AI Model Integration
   - Challenge: Supporting multiple providers and configurations
   - Impact: Flexibility and vendor independence
   - Solution: Abstract provider interface with runtime-specific implementations
